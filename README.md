### Description

Blowfish, Twofish, DES, 3DES, 3DES112, Gost, RC2, RC4, Rijndael, SkipJack, Serpent, SHA256, TEA, MD2, MD4, MD5, Huffman... ALL IN ONE EASY TO USE ACTIVEX!

Most of the cryptographic algorithms were provided by David Midkiff (thank you mate) I had to clean some bugs in the code but his work is awesome...

Before you download and use the control.. please, do NOT VOTE the test project as it is not GOOD at all... it is just to prove the algorithms... i am sure you can do better than that!... apart from the cryptoapi code(EZCRYPTOAPIOCX updated version!), the other algorithms are provided as an example on how to implement them in VB. It is far faster in another languages... It is also a good document to learn how to implement polymorphism...

Comments and votes are the most welcome...

Regards
